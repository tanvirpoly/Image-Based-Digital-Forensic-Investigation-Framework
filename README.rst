Tensorflow Installation
------------------


Learners must go with any one of the following Tensorflow CPU or GPU installations.  

CPU means: You only have a processor in your system. E.g. Intel processor.  
^^^^^^^
GPU means: You only have an NVIDIA graphic card along with the system’s processor.
^^^^^^^

If you don’t have the above option “NVIDIA Control Panel” upon right-clicking on the desktop, you only have to follow 
(a) Tensorflow CPU Installation, whereas if you have the above option, go with (b) Tensorflow GPU installation


Tensorflow CPU installation process
------------------

.. code:: shell

     conda create -n tfcpu
     conda activate tf
     conda install python=3.7.0
     pip install Cython contextlib2 pillow lxml jupyter matplotlib pandas
     opencv-python numpy==1.16.1 flask werkzeug==0.16.0
     pip install tensorflow==1.13.1    



Check whether TensorFlow is appropriately installed or not.  

Python (3.7.0) (no error should populate after installation)  


.. code:: shell

     >>import tensorflow as tf
     >>



Tensorflow GPU installation process
------------------

Download CUDA toolkit 9 or 10   

What is the CUDA toolkit?   

CUDA® is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs). With CUDA, developers can dramatically speed up computing applications by harnessing the power of GPUs.
