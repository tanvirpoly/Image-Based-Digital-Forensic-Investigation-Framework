------------------

.. code:: shell

   conda create -n tfcpu
   conda activate tf
   conda install python=3.7.0
   pip install Cython contextlib2 pillow lxml jupyter matplotlib pandas
   opencv-python numpy==1.16.1 flask werkzeug==0.16.0
   pip install tensorflow==1.13.1


   Check whether TensorFlow is appropriately installed or not.  

   Python (3.7.0) (no error should populate after installation)
